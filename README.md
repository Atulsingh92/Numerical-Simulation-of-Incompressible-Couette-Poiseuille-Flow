# Numerical-Simulation-of-Incompressible-Couette-Poiseuille-Flow
The goal in developing this simulation is to compare the velocity profiles obtained by running simulations between the komegaSST of simpleFoam solver with the experimental values obtained for couette poiseuille flow between two parallel walls.
